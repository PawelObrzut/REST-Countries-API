# REST Countries API 
This is a Frontend Mentor challenge that involves building a React app and integrating it with a RESTful API. To take it a step further, I replaced the external API with a custom-built Express server that exposes similar endpoints.

```
Objectives:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode
```

## 🛠️ Built with
- Typescript
- Styled react components
- CSS Grid
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first approach
- Node /express/
- Testing with Jest
